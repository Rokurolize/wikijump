//! Regression locks for the scp-744 epoch-38 body loss (#2573).
//!
//! Under the reverted #2596 pairing, the whole-article body vanished while a
//! literal `[[>]]` printed after the header. The current behavior pairs
//! markers on the whole expanded document, and every pair of non-literal
//! markers with no trailing whitespace becomes a `[[div]]`, so a balanced
//! marker set never leaks as literal text and no pairing state can hide
//! content. These tests lock that behavior on the exact marker shapes
//! scp-744 carries.
