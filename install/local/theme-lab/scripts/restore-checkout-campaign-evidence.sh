This is INCONCLUSIVE (exit 2), not a pass. To publish it, from a checkout whose
check-campaign-completion.mjs passes:
  python3 -I install/local/theme-lab/scripts/campaign-evidence-store.py \\
    --mode campaign-inventory --checkout-root <checkout> --store-root "${STORE}" \\
    --output install/local/theme-lab/publication/current-campaign-evidence-manifest.json
Then commit the manifest and pin its SHA-256 in MANIFEST_SHA in this script.
