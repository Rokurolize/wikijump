(***************************************************************************)
(* Re-render / hosted text-block lifecycle (2026-11-02). Protocol only.   *)
(* Facts (FINDINGS.md Step 0): a text_block row (page,type,index) names    *)
(* one S3 object under a fresh UUID; rows are page-scoped, not revision-  *)
(* scoped, and compiled HTML reaches blocks only by (page,index) through  *)
(* WWS, never by object name. Replace = read previous names (inside       *)
(* add_blocks, after inputs were read), upload new, delete+insert rows    *)
(* in the caller's txn, commit, then post-commit delete of the old        *)
(* objects (no reference check; UUID uniqueness is the guard).            *)
(* rerender_inner: no lock/version check; duplicate jobs may run          *)
(* concurrently (RSMQ 30 s redelivery). WWS reader: DB lookup, then S3    *)
(* fetch (at most ReaderOn reads are modeled, bounded at 2). Clone: DB    *)
(* and bucket copies at separate moments unless paused. Restore rewrites  *)
(* only compiled columns of snapshot revisions, guarded in FIX by         *)
(* compiled_at < switch start (CUR: unguarded). Snapshot and the switch   *)
(* clock are separate moments in promote.py, so they are separate steps.  *)
(* Assumed: block type collapsed; compiled_at as pre/post switch start    *)
(* (app clock = DB clock); unpromoted render-ahead replacement, block-    *)
(* count change, and page-deletion delete_blocks argued in FINDINGS.md.   *)
(* FreshnessGuard is check_render_freshness: a job whose read revision    *)
(* is no longer latest aborts instead of committing. CleanupOnAbort is    *)
(* false in the current code: that abort rolls the row switch back and    *)
(* leaves the uploaded object in the bucket.                               *)
