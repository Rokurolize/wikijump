"""Promote the merged develop head to the standing runtime.

One command, in this order; each stage blocks the next and a failure leaves
standing as it was (or restores it):

1. identity     the checkout is clean and exactly the fetched origin/develop.
2. validation   every check group the change since standing selects has a
                passing `preflight.sh --final` receipt whose tree differs from
                this one only in paths that do not select that group; missing
                groups run now, alongside the build.
3. build        the three application images, from BuildKit caches.
4. render-ahead when the renderer generation changes, every saved page is
                rendered with the new image while the old one keeps serving.
5. rehearsal    when activation cannot be undone by restarting the old
                containers (new migrations or a new renderer generation), the
                new images start on a copy of standing's data and must pass
                the same freshness, HTTP and browser checks first.
6. activation   park the old containers, start the new ones, require health,
                reload Caddy from the new Deepwell, zero stale saved pages,
                the HTTP canary and the standing browser parity; restore the
                parked containers (and reload Caddy from them) on any failure.

The receipt records every stage's duration and result.

With `--validation-mode attestation`, stage 2 changes and nothing else
does: the suite is never run. The stage instead requires the target head
to be composed of merged pull requests (every first-parent commit since
standing is a merge commit or belongs to a merged PR) and the validation
store to hold a per-head attestation of the targeted checks for every
group the change selects (see `wikijump.promotion_attestation.v1` below).
Render-ahead, rehearsal, activation and rollback are identical in both
modes.
