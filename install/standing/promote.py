"""Promote the merged develop head to the standing runtime.

One command, in this order; each stage blocks the next and a failure leaves
standing as it was (or restores it):

1. identity       the checkout is clean and exactly the fetched
                  origin/develop.
2. build          the three application images, from BuildKit caches.
3. rehearsal      when activation cannot be undone by restarting the old
                  containers (new migrations or a new renderer generation),
                  the new images start on a copy of standing's data and must
                  pass the same freshness, HTTP and browser checks first.
4. live-migration the candidate's pending Deepwell migrations are applied
                  to the live database with the candidate image's own sqlx,
                  while the previous release keeps serving. A migration in
                  a promoted head therefore runs against the previous
                  release, so it must be backward-compatible with it
                  (expand first: add nullable columns or new tables; drop
                  or rename only in a later promotion, once no serving
                  code reads the old shape).
5. render-ahead   when the renderer generation changes, every saved page
                  is rendered with the new image while the old one keeps
                  serving. It runs after live-migration because the new
                  renderer reads the live database.
6. activation     park the old containers, start the new ones, require
                  health, reload Caddy from the new Deepwell, zero stale
                  saved pages, the HTTP canary and the standing browser
                  parity; restore the parked containers (and reload Caddy
                  from them) on any failure.
