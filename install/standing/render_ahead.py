"""Render saved pages ahead of a Deepwell renderer-generation switch.

A renderer epoch or FTML bump makes every saved page stale, and Deepwell
refuses stale output. Rerendering only after activation therefore holds the
site in maintenance for the whole rerender. This command runs the `render-ahead`
action of the image that is about to be activated against the live database
while the current Deepwell keeps serving. The new Deepwell promotes the rows
when it starts, so activation costs a container restart.

The one-off container copies the environment and configuration mount of the
running Deepwell container and joins its network namespace, so it reaches the
same database, cache, and object store. Its entrypoint is the Deepwell binary,
not the image start script, so no migration is recorded: the command only runs
the image's idempotent render-ahead table migration, which keeps the serving
build's own migration check (and a rollback to it) working.

Rendering also refreshes link rows. Backlinks, OrphanedPages, WantedPages,
and page queries using ListPages/CountPages link_to= read those rows. Deepwell
reports every page whose render read the link graph. A link reader rendered
early in that pass may have read links that later renders changed, so the
readers are rendered again, alone, until a round leaves every link unchanged.
If links continue to change after the bounded rounds, the run fails closed:
even a nondeterministic reader can leave another reader with stale output.
Pages that miss the serving render deadline under concurrent load are retried
alone and then once with a longer one-shot deadline
(docs/agents/compatibility/execution.md); any other failure stops the run. A
final dry run checks the whole site.

Each run renders every stale page itself: rows left by an earlier run are not
reused, because only this run's own passes know which pages read links.

The full pass dominates render-ahead wall-clock (about 97% on recent
generation changes: every stale page must render exactly once, so the pass is
pure throughput). Two controller-side levers keep that throughput visible and
scalable without touching the renderer's selection, validity, or convergence
rules:

* Per-pass overhead accounting: each pass entry records `overhead_seconds`
  (controller wall-clock minus the image's own render time, i.e. container
  startup and log handling), and every link-digest snapshot is timed into
  the receipt's `link_digest_timings`.
* Sharded full pass (`--shards`, default 1): the full pass renders disjoint
  chunks of the live page-ID space in concurrent containers through the same
  `render_pass` primitive and merges their summaries. Shard 1 is the exact
  historical behavior. Only the full pass shards: reader rounds, deadline
  tail retries, and the dry-run verify stay single invocations.
