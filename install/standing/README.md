# Standing runtime operations

`compose.yaml` is the source-owned topology for the browser-facing standing runtime. The rendered home uses the role-based `wikijump-standing` project and the durable external volume names `wikijump-standing-postgres-data`, `wikijump-standing-files-data`, `wikijump-standing-cache-data`, `local-caddy-data`, and `local-caddy-config`. Never run `docker compose down -v` against this topology. Legacy `runtime50x-*` volume names are migration-only rollback inputs and are not part of the active topology.

The durable cache has a source-owned compatibility floor in
`cache-data-compatibility.json`. A standing/cache image must not be downgraded
below that Valkey version: persisted AOF/RDB data may use formats introduced by
the floor release. The hermetic compatibility suite checks both local/dev
Dockerfiles against that policy so a future base-image cleanup cannot silently
turn a standing activation into an unreadable-cache rollback incident.

## Startup topology

Warm startup latency was dominated by Docker bridge/NAT and published-port
programming per container, not by application initialization. In this topology
only Caddy is attached to the Docker bridge and publishes host ports
(`80/tcp`, `443/tcp`, `443/udp`). Database, files, cache, Deepwell, Framerail,
and WWS share Caddy's network namespace with `network_mode: "service:caddy"`, so
the engine programs one network endpoint instead of seven.

Inter-service traffic therefore uses `127.0.0.1`, not Compose service DNS, and
Caddy resolves the application upstreams through `extra_hosts`. The application
services no longer expose host ports; inspect them through the namespace (for
example `docker compose exec caddy ...`). Recreating Caddy restarts the services
that share its namespace, so a Tier 1 refresh recreates only Deepwell,
Framerail, and WWS and never stops Caddy.

Caddy, Framerail, and WWS run with `WIKIJUMP_STARTUP_READINESS=true`: they serve
an explicit `Cache-Control: no-store` 503 until a real authenticated Deepwell
`ping` RPC succeeds, then Caddy atomically loads the Deepwell-generated routes.
Deepwell keeps its `depends_on` on the base services so migrations run exactly
once against a healthy database, and it retries only transient Redis/Valkey
startup unavailability (`BusyLoading`, connection refusal) in-process instead of
exiting into a Docker restart loop. Startup 503s are acceptable; partial HTML,
stale application routes, and false 200s are not.

There are two operational tiers. Routine application refreshes use Tier 1. Tier 2 is reserved for operations that can change a named volume attachment, the Compose project name, the network name, or edge routing.

## Tier 1: promote the merged develop head

Tier 1 is the routine step after a change merges to `develop`, and it is one command. A browser-visible, chrome, layout, or DOM claim about standing needs the current merged head on standing first: a claim against an older standing SHA is not evidence about current code.

```sh
git fetch origin develop
git checkout --detach origin/develop   # in a clean checkout
python3 install/standing/promote.py --source-root "$PWD"
```

It stops at the first failing stage, leaves standing as it was or restores it, and writes `promotion-receipt.json` with every stage's duration and result under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/wikijump/promotions/<sha>-<time>/`. The stages:

1. **identity** — the checkout is clean and exactly the fetched `origin/develop`; the standing runtime records the revision it serves. Nothing runs when standing already serves this head.
2. **plan** — the change since the standing revision selects `scripts/preflight.sh` check groups (the same classifier), counts saved pages the new renderer generation makes stale, and lists migration changes.
3. **validation** — every selected group needs a passing `preflight.sh --final` receipt (from `run-consolidated-validation.mjs`, kept in `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/wikijump/validation/`) for this tree, or for a tree whose difference from this one does not select that group. A pull request's own final barrier normally provides it. Groups without one run now (`preflight.sh --groups`), alongside the build; a failing check stops the promotion by name.
4. **build** — the Deepwell, Framerail, and WWS production images, side by side, from BuildKit caches (cargo registry and target directories, the pnpm store). Deepwell uses the `standing` cargo profile: release optimisation without the whole-program LTO that alone took about 14 minutes, and incremental, so a source change rebuilds in about four minutes. The database, files, cache, and Caddy images are standing's own (they change only in Tier 2).
5. **render-ahead** — when saved pages are stale to the new renderer generation, `render_ahead.py` renders them with the new image while the old one serves (below).
6. **rehearsal** — only when migrations change. They cannot be undone: the old build's migration check refuses a schema it does not know, so its parked containers would not start again. The new images start on a copy of standing's data — a `pg_basebackup` of the database (about a minute) and a copy-on-write overlay of the object store (instant, standing's volume is only the read-only lower layer) — and must pass zero stale saved pages, the HTTP canary, and the candidate browser parity. The copy is removed afterwards.
7. **activation** — park the serving Deepwell, Framerail, and WWS containers, record the new image IDs and revision in the runtime `.env`, `docker compose up --no-deps --no-build` the three services, and require health, zero stale saved pages, the SCP-9506 HTTP canary, and the standing browser parity. Any failure removes the new containers and restores the parked ones; after a renderer generation change it first puts back the saved-page output it replaced (snapshotted just before parking), so the old build serves current pages again. On success the parked containers are removed, `runtime-differential-identity.json` is updated, and `refresh-receipt.json` (schema 4) binds the activation to the sealed build.

Activation never compiles, never stops Caddy, the database, files, or cache, never runs `down`, and has no volume or Compose passthrough option. The browser parity compares against the retained live Wikidot reference in `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/wikijump/standing-browser-reference/reference.json` (policy, reference ledger and its SHA-256, response cache, browser); it is captured once with `run-standing-browser-parity.mjs --mode live-reference` and recaptured only when the canary contract or the live pages change, never as part of a promotion.

Measured on this workstation (16 cores) on 2026-10-17: a Deepwell source change rebuilds in about 4 minutes (the old uncached fat-LTO build took about 22), the database copy takes about a minute, each browser parity about 40 seconds, and activation about a minute. Routine promotions therefore finish within ten minutes; a renderer generation change adds its render-ahead.

### Renderer generation switches: render ahead

Deepwell refuses saved output whose `compiled_generator` is not its own (`ftml vX; deepwell-render/vN`), so a release that bumps the renderer epoch or FTML makes every saved page stale at activation. `promote.py` renders them first, while the old runtime keeps serving. For diagnostics, run it alone:

```sh
python3 install/standing/render_ahead.py \
  --image <deepwell image ID> \
  --output-dir "$runtime_home/render-ahead-<wikijump-sha>"
```

The command runs the image's `render-ahead` runtime action as a one-off container in the serving Deepwell's network namespace, with its environment and configuration. It creates the `page_revision_render_ahead` table from the image's idempotent migration without recording the migration, so the serving build (and a rollback to it) still passes its own migration check. Each stale page's latest revision is rendered into that table in its own task; `page_revision` is untouched.

Rendering refreshes link rows. Backlinks, OrphanedPages, WantedPages, and ListPages/CountPages queries with `link_to=` read the link graph. Deepwell reports every page whose render read it (`link_reader_page_ids`), including queries expanded from included source. A link reader rendered early in a full pass may have read links a later render changed, so readers are rendered again until a round leaves every link unchanged. If links keep moving at the round limit, promotion is blocked: without the individual reader-to-writer dependencies, a randomly changing reader may leave another page's saved output based on old links. The 2026-10-16 standing run spent 37 of its 54 minutes re-rendering about 3,700 deterministic pages eight times and then every page again; standing had two readers under the then-current classifier, which did not include `link_to=` queries. Each run renders every stale page itself, because only its own passes know which pages read links.

Pages that miss the serving render deadline under load are retried alone, then with a one-shot `--tail-render-timeout-ms` deadline; any other failure stops the run. The receipt `render-ahead-receipt.json` records the image, generator, per-pass timings and counts, the link readers, and `stale_without_valid_ahead`, which must be `0`. A run that exits nonzero without a passing receipt has **stopped**: inspect its saved pass logs rather than waiting or promoting.

The new Deepwell promotes valid rows in one statement when it starts, before it accepts requests. A row is valid only while its revision is still the page's latest, with the same source, and has not been rerendered by the serving build since the row's inputs were read. Pages that changed after the run therefore stay stale and fail activation's freshness check, which restores the old runtime.

The candidate Framerail image is built from the production Dockerfile with origin checks enabled by default, and the standing Compose environment repeats `FRAMERAIL_CSRF_CHECK_ORIGIN=true` so the runtime cannot silently disable the check.

The standing image tier is deliberately separate from `install/local`: local images retain bind mounts and watch-mode startup for source iteration, while the promoted images are already-built production artifacts. Deepwell's image contains the pinned `sqlx-cli` and migrations and runs `sqlx migrate run` before the binary; migration handling is therefore explicit rather than silently lost when the local startup script is removed.

## Rendering the canonical home

`render.py` materializes the canonical home from a clean checkout at an exact merged Wikijump revision. Export `DEEPWELL_RPC_TOKEN` as the 64-character lowercase hexadecimal service credential before rendering; the renderer validates it and stores it only in the mode-600 runtime `.env`, never in `identity.json` or image arguments. It copies the production Deepwell config and replaces only the production domain pair with `wikijump.localhost` and `wjfiles.localhost`. Deepwell uses the locales already packaged at `/opt/locales` in the immutable production image, so the rendered home contains no checkout path or external locales bind. The renderer fails closed if the production domain block changes, the requested FTML revision is absent, either required Deepwell runtime source is missing, or the checkout identity is not exact. `identity.json` records the source tree, FTML pin, config hash, image inputs, and persistent volume names without host paths or render-time fields.

`identity.json` describes the materialized topology and is updated only by `render.py`. `runtime-differential-identity.json` describes the application artifacts currently activated by the latest successful Tier 1 refresh and is the identity input for saved-page runtime comparisons.

Rendering does not mutate the running stack. A routine Tier 1 refresh uses the already materialized home; a topology change uses Tier 2.

## Tier 2: topology, volume, network, or edge maintenance

Tier 2 is the controlled maintenance ceremony for changes to named volume attachments, the Compose project name, the network name, or edge routing. Routine source updates do not use Tier 2. The old `runtime50x-*` identities must never be introduced into a newly rendered standing home.

1. Record the current container identities, image digests, mounted volumes, network, edge owner, and passing canaries as rollback evidence. Verify the five named persistent volumes and their consumers before changing anything.
2. Build the exact merged-head images under the required lease, render a staging home bound to those identities, and validate it before touching the canonical home.
3. Activate the bounded explicit 503 maintenance response. Connection refusal, a generic 5xx, or silently serving an old candidate is not an acceptable maintenance state.
4. Stop the old standing containers without `-v`, start the merged-head topology, and verify that every named volume survives. Never prune or recreate a named data volume as part of this ceremony.
5. Verify one port-443 owner, expected project and network identities, service health, HTTP and assets, WIKIREQUEST metadata, AJAX ListPages, DOM, and unmodified `wikidot.py` lookup canaries.
6. On failure, restore the saved topology without `-v`, restore normal edge routing, and seal a failed receipt. On success, seal the promotion receipt, retain the immediate rollback image, and remove only superseded images whose lifecycle closure is proven.

Physical volume migration is explicit and rollback-preserving. Copying data to a durable name and changing the Compose attachment are separate operations; neither is an incidental effect of Compose recreation. The migration verifier must prove checksum-equivalent copies while the old volumes are quiesced before the active topology is switched.

### One-time legacy volume migration

The campaign-era `runtime50x-*` names are migrated exactly once. Stop the
standing project without removing containers or volumes, then copy and verify
all three data volumes while they are quiesced:

```sh
runtime_home="${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/wikijump/standing"
mkdir -p "$runtime_home"

docker compose -p wikijump-standing -f /path/to/current/standing/compose.yaml stop

python install/standing/volume_transfer.py migrate \
  --receipt "$runtime_home/legacy-volume-migration.json"
```

`volume_transfer.py migrate` refuses to run while any `wikijump-standing`
container is running. It resolves the currently installed Deepwell image as a
network-disabled copy/verification helper, creates only the durable
`wikijump-standing-{postgres,files,cache}-data` destinations, copies with
numeric ownership/ACL/xattr preservation, and computes the same deterministic
tree digest for the legacy source before copy, the destination after copy, and
the legacy source again after copy. A mismatch fails closed. The legacy volume
is never deleted by the migration command. If an interrupted run leaves a
partial durable destination, inspect its consumers first and rerun explicitly
with `--replace-destinations`.

After the verified copy exists, activate the merged standing topology
whose Compose file names the durable volumes. Then prove that the running
database, files, and cache containers mount only the durable names while all
three legacy rollback inputs still exist:

```sh
python install/standing/volume_transfer.py post-cutover \
  --receipt "$runtime_home/legacy-volume-migration.json" \
  --output "$runtime_home/legacy-volume-cutover.json" \
  --runtime-home "$runtime_home"

pnpm --dir install/local/wikidot-verification run offline:browser
```

Also run the ordinary standing health, SCP-9506, file/object-store,
database/cache, WIKIREQUEST, AJAX ListPages, and `wikidot.py` canaries. Only
after those pass and `docker ps -a` shows no container mounting a
`runtime50x-*` volume may the three legacy volumes be removed. Their removal is
an explicit operator action; neither Compose nor `volume_transfer.py` performs
it implicitly. The optional `--runtime-home` binding is part of the cutover
proof: it refuses a Compose file that still names a legacy volume and updates
only `identity.json`'s persistent-volume identity plus the migration receipt
hash, so an older rendered home cannot keep advertising the retired names.

### Portable backup and clean-Ubuntu restore

The same tool is the repository-owned state-transfer path for a fresh Ubuntu
WSL instance. A consistent backup includes the three durable application data
volumes plus `local-caddy-data` and `local-caddy-config`, preserving the local
Caddy CA as well as Wikijump data. Quiesce the standing stack first:

```sh
helper_image="$(docker inspect -f '{{.Image}}' wikijump-standing-deepwell-1)"
docker compose -p wikijump-standing -f "$runtime_home/compose.yaml" stop

python install/standing/volume_transfer.py backup \
  --output-dir /absolute/backup/wikijump-standing \
  --helper-image "$helper_image" \
  --gzip

docker compose -p wikijump-standing -f "$runtime_home/compose.yaml" start
```

`manifest.json` seals each archive SHA-256 plus the deterministic extracted
tree digest. Keep that directory outside the disposable checkout/WSL instance.
On the clean Ubuntu instance, install Docker, clone the exact desired Wikijump
source, make the recorded (or another compatible GNU-tar) helper image locally
available, and restore before starting standing:

```sh
python install/standing/volume_transfer.py restore \
  --input-dir /absolute/backup/wikijump-standing \
  --helper-image sha256:<local-helper-image-id>
```

Restore refuses pre-existing destination volumes, verifies every archive hash
before creating any destination, then verifies each extracted tree. Render the
standing home from the clean checkout into
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/wikijump/standing`, activate it with the
normal merged-head promotion path, and rerun the same standing/browser
canaries. No `/home/roku/wjlab` path is required; an old WJLab tree is archive
provenance only.

The archive can also be rehearsed non-destructively on the source host while
the canonical durable volumes still exist. Supply a temporary lowercase Docker
volume prefix ending in `-`; the archive still has to name the canonical source
volumes, but extraction and tree verification use prefixed destinations:

```sh
python install/standing/volume_transfer.py restore \
  --input-dir /absolute/backup/wikijump-standing \
  --helper-image sha256:<local-helper-image-id> \
  --volume-prefix restore-rehearsal-
```

After a successful rehearsal, remove only those explicitly prefixed temporary
volumes. This is the same archive-hash, extraction, ownership/xattr, sparse-file,
and deterministic-tree verification path used by a clean-host restore; it does
not read from the live source volumes.

## Historical receipt verifiers

`install/local/wikidot-verification/scripts/verify-standing-candidate-parity-admission.mjs`, `install/standing/scripts/verify-promotion-precondition.mjs`, and `emit-final-frozen-receipt.mjs` validate the receipts of the retired multi-step promotion chain (candidate parity admission, promotion precondition, final-frozen receipt, prepared receipt). Promotion no longer produces or reads them: `promote.py` runs the same checks itself in one process and records them in one receipt. They remain only because historical final-zero inputs (`verify-final-zero.mjs`, `build-compatibility-standing-matrix.mjs`) reference schema-3 refresh receipts bound to that chain.
