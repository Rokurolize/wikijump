/**
 * Cross-site guard for state-changing `+server.ts` handlers.
 *
 * SvelteKit's origin check protects page actions and remote functions, but
 * a `+server.ts` handler receives the request without it. This applies the
 * same rule to those handlers. A request is refused with SvelteKit's 403
 * message when its `Origin` is present and is neither the request's own
 * origin nor a trusted origin, or when the browser marks it
 * `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`. A request without `Origin` is not refused
 * on that basis, because browsers always send `Origin` on a cross-origin
 * POST and scripted clients send none.
 *
 * The on/off switch is SvelteKit's (`FRAMERAIL_CSRF_CHECK_ORIGIN` through
 * `csrfTrustedOrigins`), so endpoints and page actions agree.
 *
 * @returns The 403 response to return from the handler, or `null` to
 *   continue
