# Local Docker development

The normal local stack is the development stack in `install/local`. It is
deliberately separate from candidate, rollback, standing-runtime, and replay
containers. Source iteration is done with the `docker-compose.dev.yaml`
override; changing a source file only reaches the existing watcher and does
not rebuild an image or reinstall dependencies.

## Deterministic toolchain

Rust is selected by `rust-toolchain.toml` (`1.100.0`). The local Rust images are
pinned to `rust:1.100.0@sha256:e19840879045c951c905d0eaa9887f3439c62000e429963371b376bac8d38c31`.
Node and pnpm are pinned to `24.22.1` and `11.10.0`; the local Node image is
`node:24.22.1-alpine@sha256:6a1c190e17215d844926b0677f4bf87273ff7d5e54db06d3b5b5863ab0b09a3d`.
The Rust watcher helpers are `cargo-watch 8.5.3` and `sqlx-cli 0.9.0`.
Postgres, Valkey, MinIO, and Caddy use the digest-pinned references in their
local Dockerfiles.

## Cargo profiles and caches

The repository `.cargo/config.toml` selects the shared `target/` directory.
Inside local Rust containers that path is `/src/target`, backed by the named
volume `local-rust-1-99-1-target`. Registry and Git caches use
`local-rust-1-99-1-cargo-registry` and `local-rust-1-99-1-cargo-git`. Deepwell
and WWS mount the same three volumes. No checkout `target/` directory is
mounted into a container. Promotion images build in Docker with their own
BuildKit cache mounts (`docs/development/cargo-target-policy.md`).

Normal `debug`/`test` commands use the compact profiles from
`docs/development/cargo-target-policy.md`: line tables for the local package,
no debug information for dependencies, and incremental compilation enabled.
Full symbols are opt-in:

```sh
docker compose -f install/local/docker-compose.yaml \
  -f install/local/docker-compose.dev.yaml \
  run --rm -e DEEPWELL_BUILD_PROFILE=debugging deepwell
cargo test --manifest-path deepwell/Cargo.toml --profile debugging
```

`DEEPWELL_BUILD_PROFILE` and `WWS_BUILD_PROFILE` accept only `debug`,
`debugging`, and `release`; an unsupported value exits 64. `release` is never
the default. `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` is explicit and configurable (default `2` per
Rust service, four concurrent compiler jobs when Deepwell and WWS are both
building), which keeps the two independent watchers within the documented
16-vCPU WSL budget. Set it lower on a constrained host or raise it only with
an explicit measurement. `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1` is retained for the normal
loop.

## Compose lifecycle and safe cleanup

Database, MinIO, Valkey, and Caddy data use named volumes whose names start with
`WIKIJUMP_LOCAL_VOLUME_NAMESPACE`, read from the ignored `install/local/.env`.
Set a value unique to the stack before its first start:

```sh
echo 'WIKIJUMP_LOCAL_VOLUME_NAMESPACE=wikijump-local-development' > install/local/.env
```

Without it the namespace is `local`. Two stacks must never share a namespace: two
PostgreSQL servers on one data directory corrupt it, and their process namespaces
hide each from the other's `postmaster.pid`. The server entrypoint therefore holds
a lock on the data directory and a second server refuses to start. Cache volumes
for Rust and pnpm are shared on purpose. Caddy's names can never equal Standing's
`local-caddy-data` and `local-caddy-config`.

Ordinary `docker compose down` removes containers and networks while retaining
all development caches and runtime data. Never pass `--volumes` to a normal
development shutdown.

### PostgreSQL major versions

A data volume only starts on the PostgreSQL major version that created it. After
a major bump in `install/local/postgres/Dockerfile`, the server exits with
`database files are incompatible with server` on an existing volume. Stop the
database and upgrade the volume in place, then start the stack again:

```sh
docker compose -f install/local/docker-compose.yaml stop database
scripts/upgrade-postgres-volume.sh <namespace>-postgres-data --check
scripts/upgrade-postgres-volume.sh <namespace>-postgres-data
```

The upgrade cannot be undone. Add `--rollback-volume <new volume>` when the data
would be expensive to recreate. Other stacks work the same way with their own
volume name. `scripts/test-postgres-volume-upgrade.sh` proves the tool on a
throwaway volume, and the tool's image names the versions it can read in
`install/common/postgres/upgrade/`.

For a targeted Cargo cleanup, first check leases, processes, containers, and
rollback state, then inspect Cargo's plan:

```sh
cargo clean --dry-run --manifest-path deepwell/Cargo.toml --profile dev
cargo clean --dry-run --manifest-path deepwell/Cargo.toml --release
```

Only an explicitly expired, unreferenced target may be removed. This procedure
must not remove any database, upload, browser-state, MinIO, standing-runtime,
or rollback volume.
